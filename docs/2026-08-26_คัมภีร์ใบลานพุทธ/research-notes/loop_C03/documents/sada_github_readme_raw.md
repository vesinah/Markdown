> [!IMPORTANT]
> This repository contains a **legacy research implementation** of KH-SADA together with grammar resources, figures, and links to external datasets and model weights. The published PALM-SADA paper is documented here; its complete implementation, extended datasets, and production OCR system are maintained for **internal research use only**.

> [!NOTE]
> **Baseline of our methods:** our research team achieved first place in both the **isolated glyph recognition** and **word/text recognition** tasks of the ICFHR 2018 palm-leaf manuscript competition.
## Overview

Palm-leaf manuscripts preserve centuries of linguistic, religious, literary, and cultural knowledge across Southeast Asia. Automatic recognition remains difficult because these manuscripts combine degraded writing surfaces, complex glyph shapes, stacked components, limited annotations, and script-specific grammatical structures.

**Syllable Analysis Data Augmentation (SADA)** addresses this low-resource setting by combining visual learning with linguistic constraints. Instead of joining isolated glyphs arbitrarily, SADA uses script-specific glyph dictionaries and grammar forms to generate plausible syllables, words, and text sequences for recognition training.

The repository supports two connected research projects:

| Project | Scope | Recognition approach | Publication |
|---|---|---|---|
| **KH-SADA** | Khmer palm-leaf manuscripts | Grammar-aware synthesis with a CNN/attention-based recurrent recognizer | [APSIPA ASC 2022](https://doi.org/10.23919/APSIPAASC55919.2022.9980217) |
| **PALM-SADA** | Khmer, Balinese, and Sundanese manuscripts | Monosyllabic and polysyllabic synthesis with a hybrid CNN–Transformer framework | [Pattern Recognition Letters 195 (2025), 8–15](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.patrec.2025.04.031) |

The public repository is intended for research, reproducibility studies, education, and the digital preservation of low-resource historical scripts. Production deployment resources are restricted to internal research use.

## Research lineage

| Year | Milestone | Contribution |
|---|---|---|
| 2018 | [ICFHR Competition on Southeast Asian palm-leaf manuscripts](https://doi.org/10.1109/ICFHR-2018.2018.00090) | Public benchmarks for binarization, text-line segmentation, glyph recognition, and word transliteration across Khmer, Balinese, and Sundanese manuscripts |
| 2022 | **KH-SADA** | Khmer syllable analysis, grammar-aware augmentation, glyph dictionaries, and word/text recognition |
| 2025 | **PALM-SADA** | Multi-script monosyllabic and polysyllabic augmentation, hybrid CNN–Transformer recognition, and structured error analysis |



## Method at a glance

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["Isolated glyph images"] --> C["Script-specific syllable analysis"]
    B["Grammar forms and dictionaries"] --> C
    C --> D["Monosyllabic and polysyllabic synthesis"]
    D --> E["Neural word and text recognition"]
    E --> F["Decoding, evaluation, and error analysis"]
```

The central idea is to introduce linguistic validity into visual data generation. This produces more useful training samples than unconstrained glyph concatenation and enables analysis at the syllable, word, and text levels.

## KH-SADA

### Khmer Syllable Analysis Data Augmentation

KH-SADA introduces a glyph dictionary and grammar-aware augmentation strategy for Khmer palm-leaf manuscript recognition. It represents Khmer writing through component classes and grammar forms such as `C`, `CV`, `VC`, `CC`, `VV`, `CCC`, `CVC`, and `VCV`, then uses these constraints to construct training samples with plausible syllabic structure.

### Core contributions

- Khmer glyph-class and transliteration dictionaries;
- explicit grammar structures for valid glyph composition;
- grammar-aware generation of synthetic word images;
- an attention-based neural recognition pipeline;
- beam-search decoding and WER/ExpRate evaluation; and
- reusable training captions, scripts, figures, model weights, and dataset links.

## PALM-SADA

### Multi-Low-Resource Languages in Palm-Leaf Manuscript Recognition

PALM-SADA extends the Khmer-focused work to **Khmer, Balinese, and Sundanese**. It combines grammar-aware generation with a hybrid CNN–Transformer encoder–decoder and an interactive post-processing mechanism for error detection and transcription refinement.

The work was published in *Pattern Recognition Letters* in 2025:

> **Nimol Thuon, Jun Du, Panhapin Theang, and Ranysakol Thuon.** “Multi-low resource languages in palm leaf manuscript recognition: Syllable-based augmentation and error analysis.” *Pattern Recognition Letters*, 195:8–15, 2025. [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.patrec.2025.04.031](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.patrec.2025.04.031)

### Main contributions

- a unified augmentation framework for multiple Southeast Asian scripts;
- monosyllabic synthesis from isolated glyphs and grammar forms;
- polysyllabic synthesis for longer word and text sequences;
- a hybrid CNN–Transformer recognition architecture;
- script- and structure-aware error analysis; and
- interactive grammar-based post-processing.

## Getting started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/back-kh/SADA-Ancient-Palm-Leaf-Manuscripts-Recognitions.git
cd SADA-Ancient-Palm-Leaf-Manuscripts-Recognitions
```

### 2. Download the external resources

Download the [KH-SADA dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16-mLPE8QSGB4-tKpUS2q7_V2L-VgjVhi?usp=sharing) and [pretrained weights](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15km1riGn19twubZQoGFhvfsXFphGJP1R/view?usp=sharing). The legacy scripts expect a layout similar to:

```text
SADA-Ancient-Palm-Leaf-Manuscripts-Recognitions/
├── data/
│   ├── offline-train.pkl
│   ├── offline-test.pkl
│   ├── train_caption.txt
│   ├── test_caption.txt
│   └── dictionary.txt
└── KH-SADA/
    ├── models/
    └── result/
```

Confirm the downloaded filenames and update paths in `train_nmt.py` or `test.sh` if the package layout differs.

### 3. Prepare a compatible legacy environment

The KH-SADA implementation uses Python 2 syntax and legacy Theano GPU APIs. Reproduction requires a historically compatible environment with:

- Python 2.7;
- NumPy;
- Theano with `gpuarray`/cuDNN support; and
- matching CUDA and cuDNN versions.

Dependency versions were not pinned in the original release. A dedicated legacy environment or container is therefore recommended. The scripts may require porting before use with current Python, CUDA, or deep-learning libraries.

### 4. Train or evaluate

Review the dataset paths and `THEANO_FLAGS` before running:

```bash
cd KH-SADA
mkdir -p models result

# Train
bash train.sh

# Decode and evaluate with the expected pretrained filenames
bash test.sh
```

The standalone evaluation utility can be invoked as:

```bash
python compute-wer.py <recognition.txt> <ground-truth.txt> <metrics.txt>
```

## Release status and limitations
